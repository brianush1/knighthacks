In general, include the headset and controllers you use and the game or games you are having problems.

**For "it doesn't work" or not loading**, make sure the loader is inserted *into the game(s) you own* and Roblox launches in VR. If the loader isn't set up correctly or Roblox is not launching VR mode, it is up to you to resolve, or Roblox to adjust the headset.

**For headset-specific problems**, be aware that special casing for specific headsets and controllers can't be done since Roblox doesn't expose the headset or controllers you use. Specific problems, such as tracking problems, bad controller mapping, or bad controller offsets, should be reported to Roblox.

**For problems specific to how your game is built**, please include a file with the problematic section, or information how to recreate it.
